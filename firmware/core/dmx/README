This module usese the SS0 Output at "Module A".
At this module there will be a DMX signal.
This has to be converted with a bus transceiver (like the SN65176B) to be connted to a DMX-network.

This module needs also the timer module, because there will be registered a callback function for the timeing.
I used the 32bit timer.

The Makefile (here in core) must uncomented the following line:
OBJS += timer32/timer32.o

Also we have to append the following line to compile the dmx module.
OBJS += dmx/dmx.o
